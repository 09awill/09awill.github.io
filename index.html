            	<h2>Fire Extinguisher VR Training</h2>
            	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J_H0jRuowLI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            	<h3>Intro</h3>
            	<p>My most recent project developed at Lampada was a VR app for the quest 2 designed to help Humberside fire and rescue with their fire extinguisher training courses they run for external companies. Their brief was simple, they wanted an immersive way to learn how each of the different types of extinguishers worked and what scenarios to use them in. As the sole VR developer at Lampada I led the discussions regarding how we could use VR to meet the clients needs. We ran workshop sessions with the client remotely to iron out a concept and draw up some storyboards for how the experience would play out. Once we had formulated and fleshed out the concept we split up the work into sprints and then I started creating the core systems for the experience to ensure the client was happy with how it would work. </p>
            	<h3>Hose System</h3>
            	<p> One of the complexities when creating the extinguisher was getting the hose to feel and look realistic. I couldn’t find many good examples of a virtual reality fire extinguisher online, most of the approaches I felt looked rudimentary. Most either didn’t approach creating the hose at all or they used a basic rope package to make it work. With hoses being rubber the rope simulation just looked out of place. I remembered a video I had watched previously on using a Bezier curve to place game objects and then generating a cylinder mesh between them. I found some code online for creating this system and tried it out. Whilst it worked, I felt it would be better for performance to use unity’s animation jobs, so I adjusted the code to work using this system. This also means I could use other rig constraints alongside this component such as the force position which I used to ensure the final piece of the hose was always attached to the nozzle. </p>
            	<h3>Progression System.</h3>
            	<p>One of the main systems required for the project was a progression system which would give the user feedback based on how they completed tasks and would prevent them from moving forward without finishing the task they were on. On the previous project we had worked on for ARCO we had created a system which was tightly coupled with audio, relying on task audio being finished to progress the task. whilst it worked for the project, I wanted to improve the system and remove the dependency on audio. This was done by creating generic progression scriptable objects which basically would just return an array of tasks. Tasks inherit from progression object but simply just return themselves. They also add events which can be subscribed to for when the task is started, completed, or abandoned. Whilst it sounds like the progression object class could just be an interface, it needs to be a base class to allow serialisation in the editor. This allowed me to create task lists and multitask lists which could be easily setup in editor.</p>
            	<p>The progression manager worked by holding a reference to the base progression object and when the play starts it simply calls GetTasks() on the base object. As the GetTasks() function is an IEnumerable it only returns the tasks which need to be completed at the time. This means that for a normal task list where you have to complete each task in order it simply yield returns each task.GetTasks() at a time, doing this yield means it will halt returning tasks each time the progression manager has a list which needs completing. It also means that you can have a multitask object which returns an array of tasks which can all be completed at the same time.</p>
            	<p>Implementing audio was now a simple matter of creating an audio task object which inherits from the base task but calls the audio manager to play its clip when the task gets started and passes a callback to complete the task when the audio clip finishes.</p>
            	<h3>Overall</h3>
            	<p>I was happy with the overall product we created, as a two-person team this was a large project which I feel we completed to a high quality. The client loved the product they received.</p>

            	<h2>Coffee Shop Simulator</h2>
            	<img src="coffeesim.jpg" width="600" height = "300">
            	<p>I have been playing a lot of the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1599600/PlateUp/">PlateUp</a> recently. A fun cross between a rogue like and overcooked. Whilst playing, it prompted me to think about the structure of the systems at play in the game and how the interactions were written. Which made me keen to create my own prototype and explore how I would write it myself. I have also picked up an interest in specialty coffee recently, exploring different origins and roasters as well as different techniques for improving coffee brewing. This inspired me to create coffee shop simulator.</p>
            	<p> Whilst it is very much in its early stages I believe it illustrates my ability to form a solid structure when creating projects in Unity and consider the implications of my decisions further into the project. I have written its core systems in a way which will allow me to expand the game.</p>
            	<p>For example, I have used scriptable objects to represent consumables, this means I can easily swap out the models being used and create variants of each consumable. Further into the project I will be able to expand these scriptable objects to hold other data such as price and quality. </p>
            	<p>By using a component-based structure it promotes abstraction. For instance, having seperate inventory and interactable scripts means I can simply make any object an inventory without having excess clutter of the interactable script. Not only this, it means I can create other scripts such as a cleaning interactable script which will interface with the inventory when interacted with. these interactable scripts can easily be replaced to give different functionality to objects in the game.</p>
            	<p>I hope to add many features in the future such as money which can be made by serving customers their orders as quick as possible. I also hope to add ways of increasing the quality of the consumables which would gain a higher monetary reward, as is the case with coffee in real life the user should be able to do things such as use higher quality water, use a puck screen and order higher quality coffee beans. These improvements should be bought using the gold generated from playing the game.</p>

            	<h2>The Last Straw</h2>
            	<img src="thelaststraw.png" width="600" height = "300">
            	<p>The last straw was one of the first games I created with my game jam team. We created a puzzle platformer based around a vengeful time travelling scarecrow. I feel the artwork and sound for this game were exceptional; Especially as it was relatively close to the start of my Unity Development career. We used the parallax effect to create atmospheric landscapes and had a great musical piece composed for the background which had many different versions to reflect the mood of the level. Before the game jam I had been researching Craig Reynolds boids algorithm which was an interesting method of simulating flocking entities. it uses three main rules, coherence, separation and alignment. When implemented it creates the most interesting flocking pattern. When we were coming up with ideas for the game, I explained about boid flocking and suggested we make a game about a scarecrow who can control crows to solve puzzles which the team liked the sound of. We implemented a simple version of the flocking algorithm which followed the mouse when the user clicked. It was a super fun experience creating this game and we ended up winning the competition in all of the categories.</p>

            	<h2>RecyclAR</h2>
            	<img src="recyclar.jpg" width="300" height = "500">
            	<p>RecyclAR was developed for the iILRNfuser gamejam in June 2020, focused on Immersive technologies and with the theme "Earth Reborn". Our idea was to create a game to convey how important it was to recycle. You use AR to scan a flat surface on your phone which is then used as the play space. You need to pick up rubbish which is scattered around the landscape and throw it into the correct waste bins which are shown in the key at the top of the app. at the start of the game the grass is a muddy colour and a lot of the trees have no leaves but as you start to recycle and sort through the rubbish the environment starts to clean up. The grass returns to a lush green colour and the trees regrow their leaves. This game jam was a fun opportunity to learn about how to get across concepts to the player through a game's mechanics. The game was released on the play store but the apk can be found on the itchio page linked below.</p>

            	<img src="alittlelost.png" width="600" height = "300">
            	<p>A little lost was a game I believe we created for the global game jam. We wanted to create an asymmetrical VR game as we had recently taken an interest in the genre through a game called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/541930/Panoptic/">Panoptic</a>. We wanted to create a game similar to the popular Garry's Mod game mode "Prop Hunt". Our game would take place in a dark room for the VR player with only a torch and a hammer. Their aim is to prevent the person playing on the pc from getting to the door and escaping the room. You must find the player using the flashlight and hit them with your hammer. It was a challenging experience given our short deadline to produce both a VR and PC game with multiplayer, but we managed. The game is still playable from the itchio link below.</p>

            	<img src="collabostation.png" width="600" height = "300">
            	<p>Collab-O-Station was a game we created for the 3 thing game jam at Hull University. We created a local couch co-op multiplayer game for up to four players where the aim is to keep your spaceship from being eaten by space sharks. players are required to reload the main cannon with ammunition to shoot at the sharks which will head towards the ship. if the sharks manage to reach the ship and deal damage the players are required to put out any fires using the fire extinguishers and patch up any holes with duct tape. Also, occasionally the main cannon will break down and the players are required to get the spanner and fix it. This was a fun experience at using unity's (at the time) new input system which allowed us to easily add controller support and have the controllers assigned to each character. </p>

            	<p>In 2021 I competed in the 3 thing game jam at Hull University. As part of my team, we created a fun IO style game where the aim is to claim as many tiles as possible and wipe out your opponents. With there being two main developers working on this project we worked closely on a lot of the core systems with me taking a focus on the placing of objects and the firing system for the towers. While Game jams are not the best place for creating well written maintainable code, they are great for trying new ideas in games and exploring how to implement systems which you may not have tried before. </p>

            	<h2>Double Booked</h2>
            	<img src="doublebooked.jpg" width="600" height = "300">
            	<p>Double booked was a game we created in a 2019 game jam which taught me a lot about time management and the critical path with project management. Our idea for the game was to create a multiplayer rhythm-based game where players compete to take over the dancefloor. If you hit the correct buttons in time with the music, you begin to increase your score and if you hit it at exactly the right time you can start to build a multiplier. One player wins when their score is a certain amount higher than the other player. When developing this game, we had the core concept but the other developer and myself were keen that we could push ourselves and create a custom track creation tool alongside the game which we started work on towards the start of the game jam. it proved a much bigger task than we initially expected meaning when we came to actually creating the main game, we had far less time than we had hoped. This led to rushed programming and many bugs. Whilst we managed to create a game at the end of the day, it lacked polish and wasn't much fun to play. This taught me a lot about focusing on the critical path of the project, the track editor should have been a stretch goal once we had created a great core game.</p>
